### App Idea: **FocusFriend**

### App Idea: **Lift**

**Lift** is a lightweight mobile app that helps first-generation college students stay motivated and organized through daily encouragement, goal tracking, and simple journaling. Inspired by my own journey as a first-gen student from Haiti, the app is designed to make users feel supported even when they’re navigating things alone.

Features:
- **Daily Uplift**: A motivational quote or story each day
- **Mini Goals**: Create and check off small academic or personal goals
- **Quick Journal**: Write one sentence a day to reflect or vent
- **Progress View**: A simple calendar that shows goal progress and journal streaks

The goal is to keep things light and approachable—just enough structure to help users stay on track, but without adding pressure.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

- Getting the button to update the background color in real time required understanding `UIColor` generation.  
- Needed to double-check layout constraints to get labels aligned correctly.
